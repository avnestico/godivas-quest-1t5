            <h2>Style</h2>

            <p>
                Godiva Industries has a particular...style. First, they make a couple charitable donations to an institution of higher education. Then they start to get cozy with the student union. Plant a few of their people in positions of moderate authority, and then, ever so slowly, start to make changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                They're nice and subtle about it, too. One day, a vending machine goes up in price. The next, plans are revealed to modernize some decades-old tradition. The next, course selection is fiddled with.
            </p>
            <p>
                It doesn't seem like it's all connected, but the end result for all of this is more money into their grubby hands. They're a for-profit corporation with no regard for the people they affect. After all, their customer is the institution itself, right? And as long as the institution is happy, they're happy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Long story short, they need to be stopped. I'm doing what I can. You need to do the same. Together, we just might be able to stop them.

                P.S. Check the source code. It looks like they've left a link to a private network publicly accessible. I can't get in, but maybe we'll find some credentials along the way.
