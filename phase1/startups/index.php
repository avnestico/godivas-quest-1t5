            <p>
                We're leveraging the monetization of our minimum viable product in order to pivot at a 45 degree angle.
                No, the words don't mean a thing, why do you ask?

                    This company was a sporting goods outfitter for years before going bankrupt, being bought out, and
                    getting revived under its original name. For at least the past 10 years, it's switched to casual
                    wear for youth. (Last word in the name only)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Though it filed for bankruptcy over 20 years ago, this company successfully pivoted into toys after
                    leaving its original market, leather. Though it switched markets, it kept its original name.

                    One of the companies founded by members of the PayPal Mafia, this video sharing site was originally
                    a video-powered online dating service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upon finding that his clients were more interested in the free perfume samples he offered than the
                    books he was selling, a salesman pivoted into the cosmetics market. Over 40 years later, his
                    business changed its name to this one, the one it's known by today.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This blacksmith, unhappy with ploughs that couldn't cut through his area's tough clay, had the
                    bright idea of building ploughs out of cast steel. His products are found on farms and lawns across
                    the world today.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A door-to-door salesman started off selling cleaning products, offering what's now his company's
                    core product as a freebie. Eventually, his customers stopped caring about soap, but they kept buying
                    gum.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Originally in the playing card business, this company pivoted into the video game market more than
                    70 years after it was first incorporated.
