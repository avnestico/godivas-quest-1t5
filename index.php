            <h1><strong>Hello and welcome to Godiva's Quest 1T5!</strong></h1>

            <p>Godiva's Quest is an annual test of the wit and constitution of the University of Toronto's
                undergraduate engineers. Taking place from the winter break to the start of the second school
                semester, the Quest challenges students to solve a series of mind-bending puzzles in a race
                against time and their peers.</p>

            <h3><strong>The Puzzles</strong></h3>

            <p>As in past years, the Quest is split into three stages. Once the third stage of puzzles has been
                released, you will have all the tools you need to solve the Quest. Remember, you don't need to
                solve every puzzle in order to finish the Quest, but every answer you get will bring you closer
                to the solution. Answers are in the form of an alphanumeric word or phrase, and will not have
                any spaces or punctuation.</p>

            <h3><strong>The Prizes</strong></h3>

            <p>The first eligible person to complete the Quest gets all the spoils! If you win, you'll be
                awarded the coveted third judge's position for Ye Grande Olde Chariot Races, which is held on
                the Wednesday of Godiva Week; you'll be granted the title of Questmaster 1T6, which comes with
                the responsibility of writing next year's Godiva's Quest; and, most importantly, your name will
                be immortalized in history as one of the valiant few who found glory at the end of their
                Quest.</p>

            <h3><strong>The Patches</strong></h3>

            <p><a href="media/patch.jpg">This swanky patch</a> is also available as a reward for tenacious
                Questers, and the first ten people to complete the Quest will be awarded one. You're encouraged
                to work in teams, and every member of your team can win a patch if you're all fast enough.</p>

            <h3><strong>The People</strong></h3>

            <p>Frosh cannot win the whole Quest, but they are encouraged to participate and can earn patches.
                Other than frosh and past Quest winners, any University of Toronto engineering undergraduate is
                eligible to win the Quest. If nobody has completed the Quest by 23:59 EST on Tuesday, January 8,
                2015, the winner will be the person who has completed the most puzzles at that time.</p>

            <h3><strong>The Private Side</strong></h3>

            <p>Unlike in past years, Questers are encouraged to take peeks behind the veil and look for hidden
                areas of the website. Leave no stone unturned and you'll be rewarded for your efforts. The only
                exception to this rule is the php source folder - things in that folder are there for a reason,
                so please don't try to break into there.</p>

            <h3><strong>The Potts Trophy</strong></h3>

            <p>The J.P. Potts Memorial Trophy appears to have gone missing. Considering it's the trophy awarded
                to the winner of Ye Grande Olde Chariot Races (aka the thing that the Quest winner will be
                judging), you might want to keep an eye out for it...</p>

            <h3><strong>The Past Winners</strong></h3>

            <p>Previous winners are ineligible to win again, so you are <strong>not</strong> competing against
                Ryan Wills, Ang Cui, or <a href="info/history.php">a bunch of other long-gone people</a>. Of
                course, you are also not competing against the Questmaster.</p>

            <hr/>

            <h3><strong>Good luck and happy questing!</strong></h3>

            <p>- Andrew Nestico, Questmaster 1T5</p>
